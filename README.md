This is the official repository for the dataset and code accompanying the paper:

**"FutureKE: Fine-Grained Knowledge Entity and Relation Extraction from Future Work Sentences in Scientific Papers"**

FutureKE investigates future work sentences (FWS) in scientific papers and organizes them into a structured resource for frontier-oriented analysis. Based on NLP conference papers from 1952 to 2025, the project combines future work sentence recognition and entity temporal novelty analysis.

## 📚 FutureKE

FutureKE is constructed from NLP conference papers collected from ACL-related venues.  
The corpus integrates:

- **73,285 papers** with metadata and full text from [The ACL OCL Corpus](https://github.com/shauryr/ACL-anthology-corpus) (Shaurya Rohatgi, 2022) . covering **1952–2022**
- **31,555 papers** covering **2023–2025** collected from [the ACL Anthology](https://aclanthology.org/) PDFs and parsed into editable text through [DeepSeek OCR](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR)


On top of this corpus, FutureKE identifies future work sentences through rule-based filtering and a fine-tuned [SciBERT](https://github.com/allenai/scibert) classifier, and then extracts entities and semantic relations using [HGERE](https://github.com/yanzhh/HGERE).

The resulting dataset includes:

- **552,676** future work sentences from **40,773** papers
- **213,768** entities extracted from **34,975** papers
- **38,383** relation triples extracted from **11,875** papers

The repository currently contains two main code modules:

- **FWS_Recognition/**: code for future work sentence recognition
- **Raw_age_analysis/**: code for entity-year matching and temporal novelty analysis

## 🔍 Data Format

The released resources may include processed CSV files and code outputs related to:

- future work sentence recognition
- temporal novelty statistics

### FWS_Recognition output

The prediction results of **FWS_Recognition** are saved in CSV format.  
A typical output file contains the following fields:

- `acl_id`: paper identifier
- `text`: input candidate sentence
- `pred_label`: predicted label
- `prob_0`: predicted probability for class 0
- `prob_1`: predicted probability for class 1


For Raw_age analysis, typical tabular outputs may contain fields such as:

- `acl_id`: paper identifier
- `year`:publication year
- `fws_avg_age`:average Raw_age in future work sentences
- `abs_avg_age`:average Raw_age in abstract
- `sim`:similarity information for fuzzy matching
- `fws_triple`extracted entities from future work sentences
- `abstract_triple`:extracted entities from abstract

Please refer to the README files inside each submodule for the exact input and output format used by that module.

## 📈 Main Results

### Future work sentence recognition results

| **Method Category** | **Model** | **Sample Ratio** | **Precision** | **Recall** | **F1** |
|---------------------|-----------|------------------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Traditional ML | SVM | 1.0 | 0.8613 | 0.8492 | 0.8460 |
| Traditional ML | NB | 1.0 | 0.8363 | 0.8359 | 0.8358 |
| Traditional ML | RF | 1.0 | 0.8696 | **0.8624** | 0.8614 |
| Traditional ML | Logistic | 1.0 | 0.8604 | 0.8558 | 0.8551 |
| Pretrained Model | SciBERT | 1.0 | **0.8900** | 0.8464 | **0.8677** |
| Pretrained Model | DeBERTa-v3-large | 1.0 | 0.9966 | 0.9641 | 0.9801 |
| Large Language Model | Qwen3-8B-Instruct | 1.0 | 0.8918 | 0.9967 | 0.9414 |

In the subsequent large-scale recognition stage, the fine-tuned **SciBERT** model was used to identify future work sentences from **3,843,771** candidate sentences, yielding **552,676** future work sentences from **40,773** scientific papers.

### Entity-relation extraction performance

The project adopts **HGERE** for fine-grained entity and relation extraction.  
On the SciNLP test set, the model reports the following F1 scores:

| **Model** | **NER** | **Rel** | **Rel+** |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------|
| HGERE | 79.53 | 49.28 | 47.64 |

### Entity temporal novelty results

To measure entity temporal novelty, the project compares entities extracted from future work sentences with those extracted from abstracts within the same paper.

| **Source** | **Entity Counts** | **Mean Raw_age** | **Median Raw_age** | **SD** |
|------------|-------------------|------------------|--------------------|--------|
| Abstract | 567,540 | 20.06 | 20.00 | 7.08 |
| FWS | 213,768 | 16.97 | 15.00 | 11.32 |

These results indicate that entities in future work sentences tend to appear closer to their first occurrence year and therefore exhibit stronger temporal novelty.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run future work sentence recognition

```bash
cd FWS_Recognition
python run.py --mode eval --model svm --train_csv data/train1.csv --cv 10 --do_balance
```

### Predict with a saved SciBERT model

```bash
cd FWS_Recognition
python run.py --mode predict --model scibert --model_path models/transformers/deberta_fws/checkpoint-600 --input_csv data/test.csv --out_csv reports/scibert_predictions.csv
```

### Run entity temporal novelty analysis

```bash
cd entity_novelty_analysis
python run.py
```

Before running the novelty analysis module, please edit the input and output paths in `run.py` if necessary.
